# Example of encryption-decryption

Used library: `pycryptodomex`. 
Version: `3.20.0`.

## Run

`poetry init`
`poetry run crypto.py`

## Ruff checks
`poetry run ruff crypto.py`
or in VS Code:
_Ctrl_ + _S_.
Added workspace settings for VS Code. 
Now, before each save of the project, it starts `ruff`. 
Not very usable, but as a first experience with `ruff`, `VS Code` and `encryption-decryption` - fair enough.
